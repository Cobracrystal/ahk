# ahk-functionalities
Scripts and Libraries i use to simplify computer actions. 

Scripts in *Libraries* are largely not by me.

Scripts in *LibrariesV2* are by me, with the exception of the following:
- *jsongo.ahk* by [@GroggyOtter](https://github.com/GroggyOtter)
- *Websocket.ahk* by [@thqby](https://github.com/thqby)
