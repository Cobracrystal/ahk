Scripts and Libraries i use to simplify computer actions. 

As autohotkey lacks support for proper package imports, note that this repo contains some scripts included purely for convenience. Specifically:

Most scripts in *Libraries* are not written by me;

Scripts in *LibrariesV2* are written by me, with the exception of the following:
- *jsongo.ahk* by [@GroggyOtter](https://github.com/GroggyOtter)
- *Websocket.ahk* by [@thqby](https://github.com/thqby)
